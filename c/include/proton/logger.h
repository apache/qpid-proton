 *
 * Facility for logging messages
 *
 * The proton library has internal logging which provides information about the
 * functioning of the library. This Logger system (see @ref pn_logger_t) allows applications
 * to customize how the logging is recorded and output.
 *
 * Each logged message has an attached level (see @ref pn_log_level_t) which
 * indicates how important the message is; and also has an attached subsystem
 * (see @ref pn_log_subsystem_t) which indicates which part of proton is producing#
 * the log message. The levels go from "Critical" which indicates a condition the library cannot
 * recover from.
 *
 * Applications receive log messages by registering a callback function (@ref pn_log_sink_t). This
 * receives the logged message and other information and allows the application to consume the
 * logged messages as it wants. Applications can filter the messages that they receive by setting
 * bit masks in the logger. They can set the logger filtering both by subsystem and by level.
 * Additionally, since the callback contains both the subsystem and level information for each
 * logged message, applications can impose further, more complex, filters of their own.
 *
 * Each application will have a default logger which can be retrieved with @ref pn_default_logger.
 * The default logger is used as the template for every other logger that is created. So an efficient
 * way to configure logging is to configure the default logger at the very start of the application
 * before any other loggers get created.
 *
 * Loggers are associated with different proton objects, primarily the transport object
 * (@ref pn_transport_t) and each logger controls the logging for the associated object. This means
 * that for example in order to control the logging for an AMQP connection you need to acquire the
 * logger object from the transport object using @ref pn_transport_logger and to configure that.
 *
 * Initially the defaults are to log every subsystem but not any level (except 'Critical' which is
 * always logged). This means in effect that it is only necessary to turn on the log levels that
 * are interesting and all subsystems will log. Of course you can turn off subsystems that are not
 * interesting or are too verbose.
 *
 * There is also a default log sink if the application does not register their own, but logging
 * is turned on - this will output the log message to standard error.
