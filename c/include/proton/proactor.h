 * @addtogroup proactor
 * @{
 *
 * The proactor associates an abstract AMQP protocol @ref connection
 * with a concrete IO @ref transport implementation for outgoing and
 * incoming connections. pn_proactor_wait() returns @ref
 * proactor_events to application threads for handling.
 *
 * The `pn_proactor_*` functions are thread-safe, but to handle @ref
 * proactor_events you must also use the @ref core APIs, which are
 * not. @ref core objects associated with different connections can be
 * used concurrently, but objects associated with a single connection
 * can only be used from their own thread.
 *
 * The proactor *serializes* @ref proactor_events for each connection
 * - it never returns @ref proactor_events for the same connection
 * concurrently in different threads. Event-handling code can safely
 * use any @ref core object obtained from the current event. You can
 * attach application data to @ref core objects (for example with
 * pn_connection_attachments()).
 *
 * pn_connection_wake() allows any thread to "wake up" a
 * connection. It causes pn_proactor_wait() to return a @ref
 * PN_CONNECTION_WAKE event that is serialized with the connection's
 * other @ref proactor_events. You can use this to implement
 * communication between different connections, or from non-proactor
 * threads.
 *
 * Serialization and pn_connection_wake() simplify building
 * applications with a shared thread pool, which serialize work per
 * connection. Many other variations are possible, but you are
 * responsible for any additional synchronization needed.
