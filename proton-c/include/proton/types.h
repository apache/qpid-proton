 *
 * Every AMQP endpoint (@link pn_connection_t Connection @endlink,

 * @endlink) starts out in an uninitialized state and then proceeds
 * linearly to an active and then closed state. This lifecycle occurs

/**
 * An AMQP Delivery object.
 *
 * A pn_delivery_t object encapsulates all of the endpoint state
 * associated with an AMQP Delivery. Every delivery exists within the
 * context of a ::pn_link_t object.
 *
 * The AMQP model for settlement is based on the lifecycle of a
 * delivery at an endpoint. At each end of a link, a delivery is
 * created, it exists for some period of time, and finally it is
 * forgotten, aka settled. Note that because this lifecycle happens
 * independently at both the sender and the receiver, there are
 * actually four events of interest in the combined lifecycle of a
 * given delivery:
 *
 *   - created at sender
 *   - created at receiver
 *   - settled at sender
 *   - settled at receiver
 *
 * Because the sender and receiver are operating concurrently, these
 * events can occur in a variety of different orders, and the order of
 * these events impacts the types of failures that may occur when
 * transferring a delivery. Eliminating scenarios where the receiver
 * creates the delivery first, we have the following possible
 * sequences of interest:
 *
 * Sender presettles (aka at-most-once):
 * -------------------------------------
 *
 *   1. created at sender
 *   2. settled at sender
 *   3. created at receiver
 *   4. settled at receiver
 *
 * In this configuration the sender settles (i.e. forgets about) the
 * delivery before it even reaches the receiver, and if anything
 * should happen to the delivery in-flight, there is no way to
 * recover, hence the "at most once" semantics.
 *
 * Receiver settles first (aka at-least-once):
 * -------------------------------------------
 *
 *   1. created at sender
 *   2. created at receiver
 *   3. settled at receiver
 *   4. settled at sender
 *
 * In this configuration the receiver settles the delivery first, and
 * the sender settles once it sees the receiver has settled. Should
 * anything happen to the delivery in-flight, the sender can resend,
 * however the receiver may have already forgotten the delivery and so
 * it could interpret the resend as a new delivery, hence the "at
 * least once" semantics.
 *
 * Receiver settles second (aka exactly-once):
 * -------------------------------------------
 *
 *   1. created at sender
 *   2. created at receiver
 *   3. settled at sender
 *   4. settled at receiver
 *
 * In this configuration the receiver settles only once it has seen
 * that the sender has settled. This provides the sender the option to
 * retransmit, and the receiver has the option to recognize (and
 * discard) duplicates, allowing for exactly once semantics.
 *
 * Note that in the last scenario the sender needs some way to know
 * when it is safe to settle. This is where delivery state comes in.
 * In addition to these lifecycle related events surrounding
 * deliveries there is also the notion of a delivery state that can
 * change over the lifetime of a delivery, e.g. it might start out as
 * nothing, transition to ::PN_RECEIVED and then transition to
 * ::PN_ACCEPTED. In the first two scenarios the delivery state isn't
 * required, however in final scenario the sender would typically
 * trigger settlement based on seeing the delivery state transition to
 * a terminal state like ::PN_ACCEPTED or ::PN_REJECTED.
 *
 * In practice settlement is controlled by application policy, so
 * there may well be more options here, e.g. a sender might not settle
 * strictly based on what has happened at the receiver, it might also
 * choose to impose some time limit and settle after that period has
 * expired, or it could simply have a sliding window of the last N
 * deliveries and settle the oldest whenever a new one comes along.
