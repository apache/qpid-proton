/** @file
 * API for using SSL with the Transport Layer.
 *
 * A Transport may be configured to use SSL for encryption and/or authentication.  A
 * Transport can be configured as either an "SSL client" or an "SSL server".  An SSL
 * client is the party that proactively establishes a connection to an SSL server.  An SSL
 * server is the party that accepts a connection request from a remote SSL client.
 *
 * This SSL implementation defines the following objects:

 * @li A top-level object that stores the configuration used by one or more SSL
 * sessions (pn_ssl_domain_t).
 * @li A per-connection SSL session object that performs the encryption/authentication
 * associated with the transport (pn_ssl_t).
 * @li The encryption parameters negotiated for the SSL session (pn_ssl_state_t).
 *
 * A pn_ssl_domain_t object must be created and configured before an SSL session can be
 * established.  The pn_ssl_domain_t is used to construct an SSL session (pn_ssl_t).  The
 * session "adopts" its configuration from the pn_ssl_domain_t that was used to create it.
 * For example, pn_ssl_domain_t can be configured as either a "client" or a "server".  SSL
 * sessions constructed from this domain will perform the corresponding role (either
 * client or server).
 *
 * If either an SSL server or client needs to identify itself with the remote node, it
 * must have its SSL certificate configured (see ::pn_ssl_domain_set_credentials()).
 *
 * If either an SSL server or client needs to verify the identity of the remote node, it
 * must have its database of trusted CAs configured (see ::pn_ssl_domain_set_trusted_ca_db()).
 *
 * An SSL server connection may allow the remote client to connect without SSL (eg. "in
 * the clear"), see ::pn_ssl_domain_allow_unsecured_client().
 *
 * The level of verification required of the remote may be configured (see
 * ::pn_ssl_domain_set_peer_authentication)
 *
 * Support for SSL Client Session resume is provided (see ::pn_ssl_init,
 * ::pn_ssl_resume_status).
