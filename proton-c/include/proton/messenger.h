/**
 * A ::pn_messenger_t provides a high level interface for sending and
 * receiving messages (See ::pn_message_t).
 *
 * Every messenger contains a single logical queue of incoming
 * messages and a single logical queue of outgoing messages. The
 * messages in these queues may be destined for, or originate from, a
 * variety of addresses.
 *
 * The messenger interface is single-threaded. All methods except one
 * (::pn_messenger_interrupt()) are intended to be used by one thread
 * at a time.
 *
 *
 * Address Syntax
 * ==============
 *
 * An address has the following form::
 *
 *   [ amqp[s]:// ] [user[:password]@] domain [/[name]]
 *
 * Where domain can be one of::
 *
 *   host | host:port | ip | ip:port | name
 *
 * The following are valid examples of addresses:
 *
 *  - example.org
 *  - example.org:1234
 *  - amqp://example.org
 *  - amqps://example.org
 *  - example.org/incoming
 *  - amqps://example.org/outgoing
 *  - amqps://fred:trustno1@example.org
 *  - 127.0.0.1:1234
 *  - amqps://127.0.0.1:1234
 *
 * Sending & Receiving Messages
 * ============================
 *
 * The messenger API works in conjuction with the ::pn_message_t API.
 * A ::pn_message_t is a mutable holder of message content.
 *
 * The ::pn_messenger_put() operation copies content from the supplied
 * ::pn_message_t to the outgoing queue, and may send queued messages
 * if it can do so without blocking. The ::pn_messenger_send()
 * operation blocks until it has sent the requested number of
 * messages, or until a timeout interrupts the attempt.
 *
 *
 *   pn_messenger_t *messenger = pn_messenger(NULL);
 *   pn_message_t *message = pn_message();
 *   char subject[1024];
 *   for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
 *     pn_message_set_address(message, "amqp://host/queue");
 *     sprintf(subject, "Hello World! %i", i);
 *     pn_message_set_subject(message, subject);
 *     pn_messenger_put(messenger, message)
 *   pn_messenger_send(messenger);
 *
 * Similarly, the ::pn_messenger_recv() method receives messages into
 * the incoming queue, and may block as it attempts to receive up to
 * the requested number of messages, or until the timeout is reached.
 * It may receive fewer than the requested number. The
 * ::pn_messenger_get() method pops the eldest message off the
 * incoming queue and copies its content into the supplied
 * ::pn_message_t object. It will not block.
 *
 *
 *   pn_messenger_t *messenger = pn_messenger(NULL);
 *   pn_message_t *message = pn_message()
 *   pn_messenger_recv(messenger):
 *   while (pn_messenger_incoming(messenger) > 0) {
 *     pn_messenger_get(messenger, message);
 *     printf("%s", message.subject);
 *   }
 *
 *   Output:
 *     Hello World 0
 *     Hello World 1
 *     Hello World 2
 *
 * The blocking flag allows you to turn off blocking behavior
 * entirely, in which case ::pn_messenger_send() and
 * ::pn_messenger_recv() will do whatever they can without blocking,
 * and then return. You can then look at the number of incoming and
 * outgoing messages to see how much outstanding work still remains.
 *
 * Authentication Mechanims
 * ========================
 *
 * The messenger API authenticates using some specific mechanisms. In prior versions
 * of Proton the only authentication mechanism available was the PLAIN mechanism
 * which transports the user's password over the network unencrypted. The Proton versions
 * 0.10 and newer support other more secure mechanisms which avoid sending the users's
 * password over the network unencrypted. For backwards compatibility the 0.10 version
 * of the messenger API will also allow the use of the unencrypted PLAIN mechanism. From the
 * 0.11 version and onwards you will need to set the flag PN_FLAGS_ALLOW_INSECURE_MECHS to
 * carry on using the unencrypted PLAIN mechanism.
 *
 * The code for this looks like:
 *
 *   ...
 *   pn_messenger_set_flags(messenger, PN_FLAGS_ALLOW_INSECURE_MECHS);
 *   ...
 *
 * Note that the use of the PLAIN mechanism over an SSL connection is allowed as the
 * password is not sent unencrypted.

//!
//! The route procedure may be used to influence how a messenger will
//! internally treat a given address or class of addresses. Every call
//! to the route procedure will result in messenger appending a routing
//! rule to its internal routing table.
//!
//! Whenever a message is presented to a messenger for delivery, it
//! will match the address of this message against the set of routing
//! rules in order. The first rule to match will be triggered, and
//! instead of routing based on the address presented in the message,
//! the messenger will route based on the address supplied in the rule.
//!
//! The pattern matching syntax supports two types of matches, a '%'
//! will match any character except a '/', and a '*' will match any
//! character including a '/'.
//!
//! A routing address is specified as a normal AMQP address, however it
//! may additionally use substitution variables from the pattern match
//! that triggered the rule.
//!
//! Any message sent to "foo" will be routed to "amqp://foo.com":
//!
//!   pn_messenger_route("foo", "amqp://foo.com");

//! Any message sent to "foobar" will be routed to
//! "amqp://foo.com/bar":
//!
//!   pn_messenger_route("foobar", "amqp://foo.com/bar");
//!
//! Any message sent to bar/&lt;path&gt; will be routed to the corresponding
//! path within the amqp://bar.com domain:
//!
//!   pn_messenger_route("bar/*", "amqp://bar.com/$1");
//!
//! Route all messages over TLS:
//!
//!   pn_messenger_route("amqp:*", "amqps:$1")

//!   pn_messenger_route("amqp://%/*", "amqp://user:password@proxy/$1/$2");
