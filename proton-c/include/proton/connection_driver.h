 * @{
 *
 * Associate a @ref connection and @ref transport with AMQP byte
 * streams from any source.
 *
 * - process AMQP-encoded bytes from some input byte stream
 * - generate ::pn_event_t events for your application to handle
 * - encode resulting AMQP output bytes for some output byte stream
 *
 * The `pn_connection_driver_*` functions provide a simplified API and
 * extra logic to use ::pn_connection_t and ::pn_transport_t as a
 * unit.  You can also access them directly for features that do not
 * have `pn_connection_driver_*` functions.
 *
 * The driver buffers events and data.  You should run it until
 * pn_connection_driver_finished() is true, to ensure all reading,
 * writing, and event handling (including `ERROR` and `FINAL` events)
 * is finished.
 *
 * ## Error handling
 *
 * The `pn_connection_driver_*` functions do not return an error
 * code. IO errors are set on the transport condition and are returned
 * as a `PN_TRANSPORT_ERROR`. The integration code can set errors
 * using pn_connection_driver_errorf().
 *
 * ## IO patterns
 *
 * This API supports asynchronous, proactive, non-blocking and
 * reactive IO. An integration does not have to follow the
 * dispatch-read-write sequence above, but note that you should handle
 * all available events before calling
 * pn_connection_driver_read_buffer() and check that `size` is
 * non-zero before starting a blocking or asynchronous read call. A
 * `read` started while there are unprocessed `CLOSE` events in the
 * buffer may never complete.
 *
 * AMQP is a full-duplex, asynchronous protocol. The "read" and
 * "write" sides of an AMQP connection can close separately.
 *
 * ## Thread safety
 *
 * The @ref connection_driver types are not thread safe, but each
 * connection and its associated types form an independent
 * unit. Different connections can be processed concurrently by
 * different threads.
