Package proton is a Go binding for the proton AMQP protocol engine.

It alows you to construct and parse AMQP messages, and to implement AMQP
clients, servers and intermediaries that can exchange messages with any
AMQP 1.0 compliant endpoint.

Encoding and decoding AMQP data follows the pattern of the standard
encoding/json and encoding/xml packages.The mapping between AMQP and Go types is
described in the documentation of the Marshal and Unmarshal functions.
