	// and has no more buffered messages.

	// Note that that if Prefetch is false, after a Timeout the credit issued by
	// Receive remains on the link. It will be used by the next call to Receive.
	ReceiveTimeout(timeout time.Duration) (ReceivedMessage, error)

	// Prefetch==true means the Receiver will automatically issue credit to the
	// remote sender to keep its buffer as full as possible, i.e. it will
	// "pre-fetch" messages independently of the application calling
	// Receive(). This gives good throughput for applications that handle a
	// continuous stream of messages. Larger capacity may improve throughput, the
	// optimal value depends on the characteristics of your application.
	//
	// Prefetch==false means the Receiver will issue only issue credit when you
	// call Receive(), and will only issue enough credit to satisfy the calls
	// actually made. This gives lower throughput but will not fetch any messages
	// in advance. It is good for synchronous applications that need to evaluate
	// each message before deciding whether to receive another. The
	// request-response pattern is a typical example.  If you make concurrent
	// calls to Receive with pre-fetch disabled, you can improve performance by
	// setting the capacity close to the expected number of concurrent calls.
