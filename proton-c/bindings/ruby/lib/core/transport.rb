module Qpid::Proton

  # A transport is used by a connection to interface with the network.
  #
  # A transport is associated with, at most, one Connection.
  #
  # == Client And Server Mode
  #
  # Initially, a transport is configured to be a client tranpsort. It can be
  # configured to act as a server when it is created.
  #
  # A client transport initiates outgoing connections.
  #
  # A client transport must be configured with the protocol layers to use and
  # cannot configure itself automatically.
  #
  # A server transport accepts incoming connections. It can automatically
  # configure itself to include the various protocol layers depending on the
  # incoming protocol headers.
  #
  # == Tracing Data
  #
  # Data can be traced into and out of the transport programmatically by setting
  # the #trace level to one of the defined trace values (TRACE_RAW, TRACE_FRM or
  # TRACE_DRV). Tracing can also be turned off programmatically by setting the
  # #trace level to TRACE_OFF.
  #
  # @example
  #
  #   # turns on frame tracing
  #   @transport.trace = Qpid::Proton::Transport::TRACE_FRM
  #
  #   # ... do something where the frames are of interest, such as debugging
  #
  #   # turn tracing off again
  #   @transport.trace = Qpid::Proton::Transport::TRACE_NONE
  #
  # Tracing can also be enabled from the command line by defining the similarly
  # named environment variable before starting a Proton application:
  #
  # @example
  #
  #   # enable tracing from the command line
  #   PN_TRACE_FRM=1 ruby my_proton_app.rb
  #
