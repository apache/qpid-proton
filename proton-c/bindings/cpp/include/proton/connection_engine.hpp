/**
 * A connection_engine manages a single AMQP connection.  It is useful for
 * integrating AMQP into an existing IO framework.
 *
 * The engine provides a simple "bytes-in/bytes-out" interface. Incoming AMQP
 * bytes from any kind of data connection are fed into the engine and processed
 * to dispatch events to a proton::handler.  The resulting AMQP output data is
 * available from the engine and can sent back over the connection.
 *
 * The engine does no IO of its own. It assumes a two-way flow of bytes over
 * some externally-managed "connection". The "connection" could be a socket
 * managed by select, poll, epoll or some other mechanism, or it could be
 * something else such as an RDMA connection, a shared-memory buffer or a Unix
 * pipe.
 *
 * The engine is an alternative event_loop to the proton::container. The
 * container is easier to use in single-threaded, stand-alone applications that
 * want to use standard socket connections.  The engine can be embedding into
 * any existing IO framework for any type of IO.
 *
 * The application is coded the same way for engine or container: you implement
 * proton::handler. Handlers attached to an engine will receive transport,
 * connection, session, link and message events. They will not receive reactor,
 * selectable or timer events, the engine assumes those are managed externally.
 *
 * THREAD SAFETY: A single engine instance cannot be called concurrently, but
 * different engine instances can be processed concurrently in separate threads.
