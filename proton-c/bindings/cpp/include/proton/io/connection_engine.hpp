/// **Experimental** - An AMQP protocol engine for a single

/// A connection_engine is a protocol engine that integrates AMQP into
/// any IO or concurrency framework.
///
/// io::connection_engine manages a single proton::connection and dispatches
/// events to a proton::messaging_handler. It does no IO of its own, but allows you to
/// integrate AMQP protocol handling into any IO or concurrency framework.
///
/// The application is coded the same way as for the
/// proton::container. The application implements a
/// proton::messaging_handler to respond to transport, connection,
/// session, link, and message events. With a little care, the same
/// handler classes can be used for both container and
/// connection_engine. the @ref broker.cpp example illustrates this.
///
/// You need to write the IO code to read AMQP data to the
/// read_buffer(). The engine parses the AMQP frames. dispatch() calls
/// the appropriate functions on the applications proton::messaging_handler. You
/// write output data from the engine's write_buffer() to your IO.
///
/// The engine is not safe for concurrent use, but you can process
/// different engines concurrently. A common pattern for
/// high-performance servers is to serialize read/write activity
/// per connection and dispatch in a fixed-size thread pool.
///
/// The engine is designed to work with a classic reactor (e.g.,
/// select, poll, epoll) or an async-request driven proactor (e.g.,
/// windows completion ports, boost.asio, libuv).
///
/// The engine never throws exceptions.
