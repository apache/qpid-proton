Introduction     {#mainpage}
============

This is the C++ API for the proton AMQP protocol engine. It allows you to write
client and server applications that send and receive AMQP messages.

The best way to start is with the \ref tutorial "tutorial".

An overview of the model
------------------------

Messages are transferred between connected peers over 'links'. At the
sending peer the link is called a sender. At the receiving peer it is
called a receiver. Messages are sent by senders and received by
receivers. Links may have named 'source' and 'target' addresses (for
example to identify the queue from which message were to be received
or to which they were to be sent).

Links are established over sessions. Sessions are established over
connections. Connections are (generally) established between two
uniquely identified containers. Though a connection can have multiple
sessions, often this is not needed. The container API allows you to
ignore sessions unless you actually require them.

The sending of a message over a link is called a delivery. The message
is the content sent, including all meta-data such as headers and
annotations. The delivery is the protocol exchange associated with the
transfer of that content.

To indicate that a delivery is complete, either the sender or the
receiver 'settles' it. When the other side learns that it has been
settled, they will no longer communicate about that delivery. The
receiver can also indicate whether they accept or reject the
message.

Three different delivery levels or 'guarantees' can be achieved: at-most-once,
at-least-once or exactly-once. See below for details.

Commonly used classes
---------------------

A brief summary of some of the key classes follows.

The `proton::container` class is a convenient entry point into the API, allowing
connections and links to be established. Applications are structured as one or
more event handlers.

The easiest way to implement a handler is to define a subclass of
`proton::messaging_handler` and over-ride the event handling member functions
that interest you.

To send messages, call `proton::container::create_sender()` to create a
`proton::sender` and then call `proton::sender::send()`. This is typically done
when the sender is *sendable*, a condition indicated by the
`proton::messaging_handler::on_sendable()` event, to avoid execessive build up
of messages.

To receive messages, call `proton::container::create_receiver()` to create a
`proton::receiver`.  When messages are recieved the
`proton::messaging_handler::on_message()` event handler function will be called.

Other key classes:

- proton::message represents an AMQP message, which has a body, headers and other properties.
- proton::connection represents a connection to a remote AMQP endpoint.
- proton::delivery holds the delivery status of a message.
- proton::event carries details of an event.

The library provides intuitive default conversions between AMQP and C++ types
for message data q, but also allows detailed examination and construction of
complex AMQP types. For details on converting between AMQP and C++ data types
see the \ref encode_decode.cpp example and classes `proton::encoder`,
`proton::decoder` and `proton::value`.

Delivery Guarantees
-------------------

For *at-most-once*, the sender settles the message as soon as it sends
it. If the connection is lost before the message is received by the
receiver, the message will not be delivered.

For *at-least-once*, the receiver accepts and settles the message on
receipt. If the connection is lost before the sender is informed of
the settlement, then the delivery is considered in-doubt and should be
retried. This will ensure it eventually gets delivered (provided of
course the connection and link can be reestablished). It may mean that
it is delivered multiple times though.

Finally, for *exactly-once*, the receiver accepts the message but
doesn't settle it. The sender settles once it is aware that the
receiver accepted it. In this way the receiver retains knowledge of an
accepted message until it is sure the sender knows it has been
accepted. If the connection is lost before settlement, the receiver
informs the sender of all the unsettled deliveries it knows about, and
from this the sender can deduce which need to be redelivered. The
sender likewise informs the receiver which deliveries it knows about,
from which the receiver can deduce which have already been settled.
