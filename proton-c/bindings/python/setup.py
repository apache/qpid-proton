python-qpid-proton setup script

DISCLAIMER: This script took lots of inspirations from PyZMQ, which is licensed
under the 'MODIFIED BSD LICENSE'.

Although inspired by the work in PyZMQ, this script and the modules it depends
on were largely simplified to meet the requirements of the library.

The default behavior of this script is to build the registered `_cproton`
extension using the system qpid-proton library. However, before doing that, the
script will try to discover the available qpid-proton's version and whether it's
suitable for the version of this library. This allows us to have a tight release
between the versions of the bindings and qpid-proton's version.

The versions used to verify this are in `setuputils.bundle` and they should be
increased on every release. Note that `bundled_version` matches the current
released version. The motivation behind this is that we don't know how many
new releases will be made in the `0.9` series, therefore we need to target the
latest possible.

If qpid-proton is found in the system and the available versions are match the
required ones, then the install process will continue normally.

If the available versions are not good for the bindings or the library is
missing, then the following will happen:

The setup script will attempt to download qpid-proton's tar - see
`setuputils.bundle.fetch_libqpid_proton` - and it'll build it and then install
it. Note that if this is being executed outside a virtualenv, it'll install it
on whatever `distutils.sysconfig.PREFIX` is available. Once qpid-proton has been
built and installed, the extension build will proceed normally as if the library
would have been found. The extension will use the recently built library.

While the above removes the need of *always* having qpid-proton installed, it does
not solve the need of having `cmake` and `swig` installed to make this setup work.
Eventually, future works should remove the need of `cmake` by collecting sources
and letting `distutils` do the compilation.

On a final note, it's important to say that in either case, the library paths will
be added as `rpaths` to the `_cproton` shared library. Mainly because we need to
make sure `libqpid-proton.so` will be found and loaded when it's not installed in
the main system.

From the Python side, this scripts overrides 1 command - build_ext - and it adds a
new one. The later - Configure - is called from the former to setup/discover what's
in the system. The rest of the comands and steps are done normally without any kind
of monkey patching.
