  The L{Messenger} class defines a high level interface for sending
  and receiving L{Messages<Message>}. Every L{Messenger} contains a
  single logical queue of incoming messages and a single logical queue
  of outgoing messages. These messages in these queues may be destined
  for, or originate from, a variety of addresses.

  The messenger interface is single-threaded.  All methods
  except one (L{interrupt}) are intended to be used from within
  the messenger thread.


  Address Syntax
  ==============

  An address has the following form::

    [ amqp[s]:// ] [user[:password]@] domain [/[name]]

  Where domain can be one of::

    host | host:port | ip | ip:port | name

  The following are valid examples of addresses:

   - example.org
   - example.org:1234
   - amqp://example.org
   - amqps://example.org
   - example.org/incoming
   - amqps://example.org/outgoing
   - amqps://fred:trustno1@example.org
   - 127.0.0.1:1234
   - amqps://127.0.0.1:1234

  Sending & Receiving Messages
  ============================

  The L{Messenger} class works in conjuction with the L{Message} class. The
  L{Message} class is a mutable holder of message content.

  The L{put} method copies its L{Message} to the outgoing queue, and may
  send queued messages if it can do so without blocking.  The L{send}
  method blocks until it has sent the requested number of messages,
  or until a timeout interrupts the attempt.


    >>> message = Message()
    >>> for i in range(3):
    ...   message.address = "amqp://host/queue"
    ...   message.subject = "Hello World %i" % i
    ...   messenger.put(message)
    >>> messenger.send()

  Similarly, the L{recv} method receives messages into the incoming
  queue, and may block as it attempts to receive the requested number
  of messages,  or until timeout is reached. It may receive fewer
  than the requested number.  The L{get} method pops the
  eldest L{Message} off the incoming queue and copies it into the L{Message}
  object that you supply.  It will not block.


    >>> message = Message()
    >>> messenger.recv(10):
    >>> while messenger.incoming > 0:
    ...   messenger.get(message)
    ...   print message.subject
    Hello World 0
    Hello World 1
    Hello World 2

  The blocking flag allows you to turn off blocking behavior entirely,
  in which case L{send} and L{recv} will do whatever they can without
  blocking, and then return.  You can then look at the number
  of incoming and outgoing messages to see how much outstanding work
  still remains.

  """
  The L{Data} class provides an interface for decoding, extracting,
  creating, and encoding arbitrary AMQP data. A L{Data} object
  contains a tree of AMQP values. Leaf nodes in this tree correspond
  to scalars in the AMQP type system such as L{ints<INT>} or
  L{strings<STRING>}. Non-leaf nodes in this tree correspond to
  compound values in the AMQP type system such as L{lists<LIST>},
  L{maps<MAP>}, L{arrays<ARRAY>}, or L{described values<DESCRIBED>}.
  The root node of the tree is the L{Data} object itself and can have
  an arbitrary number of children.

  A L{Data} object maintains the notion of the current sibling node
  and a current parent node. Siblings are ordered within their parent.
  Values are accessed and/or added by using the L{next}, L{prev},
  L{enter}, and L{exit} methods to navigate to the desired location in
  the tree and using the supplied variety of put_*/get_* methods to
  access or add a value of the desired type.

  The put_* methods will always add a value I{after} the current node
  in the tree. If the current node has a next sibling the put_* method
  will overwrite the value on this node. If there is no current node
  or the current node has no next sibling then one will be added. The
  put_* methods always set the added/modified node to the current
  node. The get_* methods read the value of the current node and do
  not change which node is current.

  The following types of scalar values are supported:

   - L{NULL}
   - L{BOOL}
   - L{UBYTE}
   - L{USHORT}
   - L{SHORT}
   - L{UINT}
   - L{INT}
   - L{ULONG}
   - L{LONG}
   - L{FLOAT}
