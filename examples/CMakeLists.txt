# NOTE: The examples and their build files are self-contained, and installed
# stand-alone independent of the library build tree. They must build and work in
# this mode.
#
# For self-test purposes, the library and binding CMake files can provide extra
# settings in <LANGUAGE>_EXAMPLE_* variables - for example to enable extra error
# checking or ensure compiler consistency with the library build. However, the
# examples must also build correctly stand-alone, with none of those variables set.
