The examples in this directory provide a basic introduction to the
proton reactor API and are best viewed in the order presented below.

The examples contain comments that explain things in a tutorial-style
manner. At some point soon this content will be pulled out into a
proper tutorial that references the relevant code snippets from these
examples. Until then please bear with this clumsy style of
presentation.

This API is present in Java and Python as well.  Most of these examples will
transliterate into C in a fairly straightforward way.
