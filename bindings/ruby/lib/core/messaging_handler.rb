module Qpid::Proton

  # A handler for AMQP messaging events.
  #
  # Subclass the handler and provide the #on_xxx methods with your event-handling code.
  #
  # An AMQP endpoint (connection, session or link) must be opened and closed at
  # each end.  Normally proton responds automatically to an incoming
  # open/close. You can prevent the automatic response by raising
  # {StopAutoResponse} from +#on_xxx_open+ or +#on_xxx_close+. The application becomes responsible
  # for calling +#open/#close+ at a later point.
