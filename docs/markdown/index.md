Proton is a library for speaking AMQP, including:

- The AMQP [Messenger API](messenger/index.html), a simple but powerful interface to send and receive
  messages over AMQP.
- The [AMQP Protocol Engine](engine/engine.html), a succinct encapsulation of the full
  AMQP protocol machinery.

Proton is designed for maximum embeddability:

- minimal dependencies
- minimal assumptions about application threading model

Proton is designed to scale up and down:

- transparently supports both simple peer to peer messaging and complex
globally federated topologies

Proton is multi-lingual:

- Proton-C - a C implementation with language bindings in Python, Php, Perl,
Ruby, and Java (via JNI).
- Proton-J - a pure Java implementation
